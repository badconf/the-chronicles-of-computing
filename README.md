- [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/about/history/): After a password-sniffing attack at his university network, Tatu Ylönen designed the first version of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

## Programming Languages

- [FORTRAN](https://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~pa/f90Notes/HTMLNotesnode5.html): Fortran, which originally stood for IBM Mathematical FORmula TRANslation System but has been abbreviated to FORmula TRANslation, is the oldest of the established high-level languages, having been designed by a group in IBM during the late 1950s.
- [Lisp](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/331/resources/papers/Evolution-of-Lisp.pdf): The structure of Lisp makes it easy to extend the language or even to implement entirely new dialects without starting from scratch.
- [COBOL](https://www.thepowermba.com/en/blog/cobol-the-legendary-programming-language-that-you-have-to-know-about): By 1959, computers were nothing more than giant, clunky calculators, with primitive and extremely complicated programming languages – all dinosaurs.
- [C](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html): The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system.
- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.in/sql/history): SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language for managing and manipulating relational databases.
- [C++](https://cplusplus.com/info/history/): The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979, when Bjarne Stroustrup was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis.
- [Perl](https://yapc.tv/history-of-perl/): The programming language Perl has been around for a long time.
- [HTML](https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/webd2/student/unit1/module3/html_history.html): The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.
- [CSS](https://www.bu.edu/lernet/artemis/years/2020/projects/FinalPresentations/HTML/historyofcss.html): CSS was created HÃ¥kon Wium Lie to allow web designers to change the layout, colors, and fonts of their websites.
