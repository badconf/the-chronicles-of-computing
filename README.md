## Languages

- [C](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html): The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system.
- [Java](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/java-the-legend/9781492048299/ch01.html): The first public release of Java was May 23, 1995, as an alpha available only on Sun Microsystem’s Solaris operating system.
- [Lisp](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/331/resources/papers/Evolution-of-Lisp.pdf): The structure of Lisp makes it easy to extend the language or even to implement entirely new dialects without starting from scratch.
